Academic Knowlege (Various)
Skill Type: Advanced.
Characteristic: Intelligence.
Description: Use Academic Knowledge to remember pertinent facts and figures, and (if you have access to the proper facilities or resources) to do research. Academic Knowledge represents a depth of learning far beyond Common Knowledge and requires extensive study. Academic Knowledge is unusual in that it is not one skill, but many and each must be acquired individually. Each Academic Knowledge skill is a separate field of study, with the specialty noted in parenthesis. For example, Academic Knowledge (Religion) is a different skill than Academic Knowledge (History). The most common Academic Knowledge skills are the Arts, Astronomy, Daemonology, Engineering, Genealogy/Heraldry, History, Law, Magic, Necromancy, Philosophy, Runes, Science, Strategy/Tactics, and Theology.

Related Talents: None.

Blather
Skill Type: Advanced.
Characteristic: Fellowship.
Description: Use this skill to stall for time by running off at the mouth. Blathering never makes sense (use Charm for that); it only seeks to confuse. Victims of a successful Blather Skill Test are allowed a Will Power Test to see through the ruse. If they fail, they can do nothing for one round, as they stare dumbfounded and wonder if you are drunk, crazy, or both. You cannot use Blather if the targets are in combat or in clear and present danger. You can affect one person for each 10 points of your Fellowship, though they must understand the language you are speaking for Blathering to work.
Related Talents: None.

Channeling
Skill Type: Advanced.
Characteristic: Will Power.

Charm
Skill Type: Basic.
Characteristic: Fellowship.
Description: Use this skill to manipulate others. Charm Tests can be used to change the minds of individuals and small groups, to lie convincingly, to bluff, and even to beg.

You can affect one person for each 10 points of your Fellowship, though they must understand the language you are speaking for your Charm to be effective.

Charm Animal

Related Talents: None.

Common Knowledge (Various)
Skill Type: Advanced.
Characteristic: Intelligence.
